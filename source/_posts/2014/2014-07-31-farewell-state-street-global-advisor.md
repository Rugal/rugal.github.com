Dear Friends:


As many of you may know today is my last day at `SSgA`. I had a wonderful run for the past 8 months working with most talented group of people, it is very fortunate to have this opportunity to work with some of the heaviest projects during this time. I am very proud to be part of you.    
As my first job in my life, it is rather impressive to have such a harmony working environment to work in, everyone wears gentle and warm smile. I feel release and crave for working here.   
I have met so many great people in the past time; I want to send my sincerest gratitude to you, my manager: Wei Biao, you are so experienced and considered as expert; my helpful and enthusiastic colleagues Wang Xin, Tao ShuangLiang, Ding Han, cherubic Celia, my CRS team, the QA team for all the great support. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be part of this great team. It is you that make me believe there must be such a perfect place that filled with gentle people like you.   


Each person has a disparate fate and destiny. With my own belief, I am destined and willing to tackle with harsh dilemmas in my life, which many people may considered as `crazy`.  
I never reckon high salary or best facilities could do any benefit for the realization of my personal ideal in China, compare with those above, I prefer things that seems hard to deal with but will eventually purify and upgrade me, like “DBA” and “Study abroad”.  


I personally love the feel of reincarnation, again and over again, which is to know the higher mountain, the broader horizon, the cleverer and more ambitious people that I can meet, the larger data set I could address in the future, to surprise me each day when I wake up with better impression to this world. It is this feeling that drives me persevering endeavors over years.  
Now it is the time to continue this trip, for the glory liberty, for the spectacular dream.  

 
Bookmark and visit [rugal.ga](http://rugal.ga) for my quotidian updates if you do like me, it carries almost all my basic contact information and recent meditation.   
I do not like to use so many prevalent IM softwares except for QQ (`359788955`).   
Hence it is best to keep in touch via [gmail](mailto:ryujinwrath), I would check mailbox frequently.  


Farewell my friend, I will miss you all; wish you all the best for the future, to pursue your dream, be you own.

Sincere
